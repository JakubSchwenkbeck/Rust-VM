VM:


-> memory fragmentation!!!

- OS :

   

    -> Booting

    -> Manage Virtual Memory:
       - implement system for memory management
       - each process has own memory spaces
       - relative adressing?

    -> File creation, manipulation (create .txt and let it be manipulated)

    -> User input into console 
       - enable memory manipulation via terminal
       - enable file creation
       - enable getting vm specs
       - enable getting file specs
       - load files and execute them

    -> File explorer via terminal

   -> let the console input be instructions like 5+5 and calculate in regs?
