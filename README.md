**16 Bit Virtual Machine in Rust**


Learning Rust while writing a Vm sounds like fun, no?
By Reading the Rust Book and watching Youtube, I'm trying a hybrid 'learning by doing' approach for this project.
Idea for the Project from TomMarksTalksCodeLive

The 16 Bit Virtual Machine builds on Rust's strong back-end features and also implements an own assembler language + decoder enabeling machine code level access.

The VM has a Command Line Interface for User I/O and implements an own OS with a file-manager, memory-manager and UI-manager
